          This site runs a private, invite-only season-long NFL prediction contest for a small
          group of personal friends. It is not a public product, and it does not collect data
          from, or send messages to, anyone outside that group.

            Phone number (entirely optional), used only to add you to a group text thread with
            draft and score updates. This is collected exclusively through a web form on the My
            Picks page, where you enter your own number and check an unchecked-by-default consent
            checkbox before it is saved — declining to check it means no phone number is stored
            and no messages are sent, with no effect on your participation in the contest.

          How we use it
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your information is used solely to run the contest: tracking picks and scores, showing
          standings to the other participants, and — if you&apos;ve provided a phone number —
          sending you SMS/MMS updates about the draft (e.g. when it&apos;s your turn, when a pick
          is made, when the draft or season ends) through Twilio, our messaging provider. We do
          not use your information for marketing, and we do not sell or share it with any other
          third party.

            <strong>No sharing of mobile information:</strong> No mobile information will be
            shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. All the
            above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this
            information will not be shared with any third parties.

          <li>
            <strong>Message frequency:</strong> message frequency varies with contest activity —
            typically a handful of messages during the live draft, plus occasional updates during
            the season. No recurring or scheduled messages are sent outside of contest events.

        <p>
          Only the other participants in your contest (a small, fixed group of about 5 people)
          and the contest organizer can see your name, picks, and standings. Your phone number is
          never shown to other participants — it is only used internally to deliver text
          messages.

        <p>
          You can stop receiving texts at any time by replying STOP, or by removing your phone
          number from your profile on the My Picks page. Doing so does not affect your
          participation in the contest itself.
